# Wheat Kernel Predictor

Wheat kernel Predictor is a web app which has a Machine Learning model running at the back. The purpose of developing this app is to predict the class of the seed based on the various parameters.the dataset has being taken from the uci repository which has following parameters: 
Area,Perimeter, Compactness, Length of kernel, Width of kernel, Asymmetry coefficient, Length of kernel groove.

Tech Stack Used
Front-End: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to create the structure and content of the web pages.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling the HTML elements to make the web pages visually appealing.
Bootstrap is a front-end framework that helps in designing responsive and mobile-first websites quickly and efficiently.
Back-End: Flask

Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python. It is used to build the back-end of the application, handle HTTP requests, and render the appropriate responses. Flask makes it easy to develop web applications by providing a simple and flexible structure.
IDE: Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook is an interactive development environment that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is particularly useful for data analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
## How to run this app
* First create a virtual environment by using this command:
* conda create -n venv/ python=3.8.16
* Activate the environment using the below command:
* conda activate venv/
* Then install all the packages by using the following command
* pip install -r requirements.txt
* Now for the final step. Run the app python app.py
## Notebook Folder
